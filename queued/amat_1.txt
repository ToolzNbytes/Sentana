1911 A boy named John hangs from an oak. He hangs by his legs which grip the limb and he sees the world in reverse. The white house. The green lawn of wildflowers. John has no one who loves him. His mother wishes he had been stillborn. His father was made simple by a club to the skull and has not the cognizance to love anyone. Not himself. Not his son. Not the God who made him or the man who unmade him. John can see his mother through the window. He can see his father. She dabs at the man's head, removing sweat. His father stares forward at nothing. She hates him. It is in her movement. A secret she does not hide. His father could not know. Her boy should have been dead and If John hated the woman her hate was justified. He remembered how she would lead him to swamps and rivers which line Gilead's pine. Lead him by the hand as a mother does. And then walk away. John had not known why all the other mothers would not let their children in the water alone. Children older than he. Then a boy of eight drowned in the swamp. Surfaced bloated, his face still submerged, the back of him pale and round as a moon in the dark water. He had once been swept away by a river. Hit his head on a rock. She had almost got her wish. But he had grasped a root and pulled himself onto the bank and lain there in the mud breathing. He had crawled back to the house trailing blood and water and when she saw him she burst into tears. She felt his headwound frantically. She grabbed him as a mother should. She swaddled him in blankets and warmed him by the flame and held him to her chest and wept. John had not known if she was sobbing for what she had almost done or what could have almost happened. As she swaddled him John felt a cloying fear. And arched his head so that the blanket could never cover his mouth. could not steal his breath
