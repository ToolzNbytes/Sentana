# Sentence Structure Explorer

## A visual breakdown of sentence structure across authors.

*README file*

This is a free tool, without advertisement, without tracking, without cookies.

It's meant for:

1- browsing and reviewing sentences structures

2- comparing sentence structures as a whole

Longer version:

1- **Study the prose of great writers by comparing sentence-level structural signatures.**

2- **Explore how their sentences are crafted through varied building blocks and features, and how authors mix structures and sentence lengths to shape the flow of their prose.**

Improvements I'm thinking of:

* Special support of dialogues (avoiding those at the moment): attribution, who is speaking, insertion and action tags.
* A mark so that we can see where we made a special comment on a sentence or a phrase
* A assisted analyzer to speed up the parsing of new excepts
* More translations and languages other than English

If you feel confident in your skills for:

* Improving the tool (js, html, css)

* Adding more pieces of works 'analyzed' for display

Then you can reach me by posting a comment in a related post from me on reddit https://www.reddit.com/user/toolznbytes/submitted/

Bug or issues:

* New deconstructor feature has a few issues to work on (punctuation to preserve, ...)

*Done with free time I took from my other projects that suffered from this... but I'm happy with the result.*
